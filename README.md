# README-Generator

## Description
A README generator that creates a professional ReadMe file based off responses from Inquirer prompts.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.JS

## Installation
Go to the README Generator Repository, then clone the repo onto your machine. Install node & inquirer in order to run the following npm package dependencies. Finally, run the application with the command node app.js

## Usage
When you run node app.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your project & GitHub info.

The application then takes your responses to generate a markdown and a table of contents based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts. The README will also include badges for the license used.
